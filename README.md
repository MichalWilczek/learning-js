# learning-js
This repository stores the code I developed while learning JavaScript from [Miroslaw Zelent courses](https://miroslawzelent.pl/kurs-javascript/). 

The code is mostly rewritten from examples given by Mr. Zelent. I keep it here to have an easy access for myself whenever I'll try to develop my own webpages.
